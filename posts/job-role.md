As a frontend engineer I split my job role into 3 areas respectively UX, UI and then frontend.

in UX what I do mostly is the, analyzing user and start the preliminary investigation, this includes creating user personas, identify user groups, targeting devices, and create a visual hierarchy apply color theory (for an instance red color - which makes you feel hungry (kfc, mc), and blue color - which makes you safe and relaxed and so on).

once UX part is completed I move to UI part. In UI the first thing is to figure out the layouts of the app. whether its going to be a responsive one or an adaptive one. Once that is done you start designing the application in one of the designing tools such as Adobe XD or sketch. Tool doesn't matter if you know the designing principles. This is a critical stage becoz app's look and feel will be finalized in this stage. After that I move to implementation part of the application and start implementing it with html and css, mostly I would go with a preprocessor like sass so you can write dry code that will be much faster. While implementing the web I like go with mobile first approach. Then I validate the html and css semantically and syntactically and finally add basic support for SEO.

Thats about the UI part and now comes the real game, frontend. What i mean by frontend here is not the visual part by the logical part, which is Javascript. We all know that standardised scripting language for JavaScript is the EcmaScript, and I have been folowing industry standards for the past projects. you know, anything is easy if you know the core concepts in any language like in javascript if you know value vs reference variables, scopes and closures, variable hoisting, this keyword, Array Methods, Prototypical Inheritance, Callbacks and Promises, Event Loop and Event Bubbling.
